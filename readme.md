# JavaScript calculator

A calculator made using JavaScript, Node.js specifically. Requires the `prompt-sync` module for CLI inputs.

Like my other calculator projects, it is purely for exercise.
I do however plan on adding more features towards this project, maybe it will be my *flagship* calculator project - at the moment, I would consider my [Ruby calculator](https://github.com/luqmanity/ruby-calculator) as my flagship (it has variables, ans, logging, etc).
